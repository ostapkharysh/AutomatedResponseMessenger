# AutomatedResponseMessenger

## Project details
Here is an implementation of ideas of how automated response could work.

The Dataset for an automated response is taken from here:<br/>

The Dataset went through DocToVec algorithm and data for training is here:<br/>

- [x] Dataset investigations (Linear and Logistic regression)
- [x] CNN designed
- [x] DocToVec implemeted
- [x] Proved that  data after DocToVec algorithm could result in better accuracy ==> better system work.
