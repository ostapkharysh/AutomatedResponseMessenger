# AutomatedResponseMessenger


Here is an implementation of ideas of how automated response could work.

The Dataset for an automated response is taken from here:

The Dataset went through DocToVec algorithm and data for training is here:

Done:
Dataset investigations (Linear and Logistic regression)
CNN designed
DocToVec implemeted
Proved that  data after DocToVec algorithm could result in better accuracy ==> better system work.
